# Problem #48 ([Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/) | Array, Math, Matrix)

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by ***90*** *degrees (clockwise)*.

You have to rotate the image **`in-place`**, which means you have to modify the input *2D matrix* directly.

**DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation**.
