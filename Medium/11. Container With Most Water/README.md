# Problem #11 ([Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/) | Array, Greedy, Two Pointers)

You are given an integer array height of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the **i<sup>th</sup>** line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

*Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.*

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Input:**

    height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
<br/>

**Output:**

    49
<br/>

**Explanation:**
```
    The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
